# VerifyMe - Future Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the planned future development path for the VerifyMe application, building upon the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) concept and design prototype submitted for the Google Solution Challenge 2025. The roadmap is divided into phases, representing a progression from foundational development to broader features and potential deployment.

Our vision is to create a robust, secure, and user-friendly system that significantly enhances the efficiency and accessibility of voter verification.

## 2. Phase 1: Functional MVP Development & Pilot Testing (Short-Term)

This phase focuses on translating the design prototype into a working application and validating the core verification flow.

* **Develop Core Application (Flutter):**
    * Build the mobile application for iOS and Android using Flutter based on the approved UI/UX design.
    * Implement user navigation and screen flows.
    * Integrate device camera access for ID and face capture.
* **Setup Backend Infrastructure (Firebase/GCP):**
    * Configure Firebase Authentication (if required for user management).
    * Set up Firestore database and define data models for storing verification status.
    * Develop and deploy initial Cloud Functions to handle API requests from the app.
* **Basic AI Integration (Vertex AI):**
    * Integrate Vertex AI Vision API via Cloud Functions for basic Document OCR on scanned IDs.
    * Integrate Vertex AI Vision API for foundational Face Detection and Liveness checking.
* **Implement Core Verification Logic:**
    * Develop backend logic within Cloud Functions to orchestrate the calls to Vertex AI services.
    * Implement basic processing of AI results and update verification status in Firestore.
    * Implement secure data transfer between the app and Cloud Functions.
* **Initial Testing & User Feedback:**
    * Conduct internal testing of the end-to-end flow.
    * Perform usability testing with a small, controlled group of users to gather feedback on the app's flow, clarity, and ease of use.
    * Iterate on the MVP based on initial feedback.
* **Security Foundations:**
    * Implement essential security practices (HTTPS, basic Firestore rules, secure API handling).

## 3. Phase 2: Enhancement & Refinement (Medium-Term)

Building on the functional MVP, this phase focuses on improving accuracy, robustness, user support, and accessibility.

* **Advanced AI & Verification Logic:**
    * Refine Vertex AI integration for improved OCR accuracy across different ID types and conditions.
    * Enhance Face Verification logic, potentially including comparison between the live face scan and the photo extracted from the ID document (*requires careful handling of PII*).
    * Implement more sophisticated liveness detection techniques available via Vertex AI.
    * Develop more robust validation rules for data extracted from IDs.
    * Improve error handling and provide clearer user guidance for failed verification attempts.
* **User Support Integration:**
    * Integrate the Gemini API (via Cloud Functions) to provide an in-app chatbot for user support, answering FAQs and assisting with the process.
* **Accessibility Audit & Improvements:**
    * Conduct thorough accessibility testing based on WCAG guidelines.
    * Implement necessary enhancements for screen readers, dynamic text sizing, color contrast adjustments, etc.
* **Performance & Scalability Testing:**
    * Perform load testing on the backend infrastructure (Cloud Functions, Firebase, Vertex AI calls) to ensure it can handle peak usage scenarios (e.g., the day before an election).
    * Optimize application performance on various devices.
* **Define Polling Booth Integration:**
    * Research and define the technical requirements and process for the final, quick face scan verification step at the polling booth. This may involve specific hardware/software considerations at the booth level and requires coordination with potential stakeholders.

## 4. Phase 3: Expansion & Long-Term Vision

This phase focuses on broader adoption, deeper integration, and continuous improvement.

* **Multi-Lingual Support:** Add support for multiple languages relevant to the target user base (e.g., Hindi and major regional languages in India).
* **Official Integrations (Subject to Partnerships):**
    * Explore secure API integrations with official electoral databases for enhanced verification (requires formal partnerships and strict compliance).
    * Integrate features to help users find their registered polling booth location using official data sources/APIs.
* **Advanced Security & Fraud Detection:**
    * Continuously monitor and enhance security measures.
    * Explore advanced AI techniques for detecting sophisticated fraud or impersonation attempts.
* **Pilot Programs & Partnerships:**
    * Engage with Election Commissions or relevant authorities to propose and potentially conduct official pilot programs in limited areas.
    * Build partnerships necessary for wider adoption.
* **Analytics & Improvement:**
    * Implement privacy-preserving analytics to monitor system performance, success/failure rates, and identify areas for improvement in the user flow or verification process.
* **Offline Considerations:** Investigate possibilities for limited offline functionality where feasible (e.g., securely caching verification status).
