# VerifyMe - Planned Technical Architecture

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the planned technical architecture for the VerifyMe mobile application's Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goal is to create a secure, scalable, and reliable system for pre-election identity verification, leveraging Google Cloud technologies for core functionalities like AI-powered verification and backend management.

This architecture describes the intended structure and data flow for the functional application. The current submission for the Solution Challenge consists of the design prototype and documentation based on this plan.

## 2. Architecture Diagram (Conceptual)

**Flow:** The User interacts with the Flutter App. For verification steps, the App securely sends data (images) to Cloud Functions. Cloud Functions orchestrate calls to Vertex AI Vision APIs for analysis (OCR, Face/Liveness). Results and status updates are stored in Firestore and communicated back to the App. Firebase Auth may handle user sessions. Gemini API might be called for user support queries.

## 3. Components

### 3.1. Frontend Mobile Application

* **Technology:** Flutter SDK
* **Platform:** iOS, Android
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Provide the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) based on the prototype design.
    * Handle user input and navigation.
    * Securely access the device camera for capturing Government ID images and facial scans (video/images).
    * Request necessary permissions (camera, potentially network).
    * Communicate securely (HTTPS) with backend Cloud Functions via API calls, sending image data and receiving verification status.
    * Display verification status and relevant information to the user.
    * (Optional) Integrate a chat interface to interact with the Gemini API for support.

### 3.2. Backend Services

* **Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Firebase
* **Components:**
    * **Cloud Functions for Firebase:**
        * **Role:** Act as the primary backend API endpoints for the mobile app. Provide serverless, scalable compute.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Receive secure image/data uploads from the mobile app.
            * Orchestrate the verification workflow.
            * Call appropriate Vertex AI Vision APIs (OCR, Face/Liveness) with the received data.
            * Process responses from Vertex AI.
            * Implement core business logic (e.g., validation checks, comparison logic - *requires careful design*).
            * Update verification status and potentially store relevant (non-sensitive or encrypted) data in Firestore.
            * Send status responses back to the mobile app.
            * (Optional) Mediate calls to the Gemini API for the support chatbot.
    * **Firestore:**
        * **Role:** NoSQL cloud database for storing application state and data.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Store user verification status (e.g., `NotStarted`, `DocumentScanComplete`, `FaceScanComplete`, `Verified`, `Failed`).
            * Potentially store user profile information (linked via secure IDs, *handling PII requires strict compliance*).
            * Store non-sensitive metadata related to the verification process.
            * Data access secured via Firestore Security Rules.
    * **Firebase Authentication (Optional):**
        * **Role:** Handle user sign-in and session management.
        * **Responsibilities:** Securely authenticate users (e.g., via phone number OTP or other methods linked to voter registration - *requires careful consideration of privacy and integration feasibility*). Provide secure user IDs (UIDs) to associate data in Firestore.

### 3.3. AI Services (Google Cloud)

* **Platform:** Vertex AI
* **Components:**
    * **Vertex AI Vision (Document OCR):**
        * **Role:** Perform Optical Character Recognition on uploaded Government ID images.
        * **Responsibilities:** Receive ID images (via Cloud Functions) and return structured text data (Name, ID Number, DOB, etc.).
    * **Vertex AI Vision (Face Detection, Comparison, Liveness):**
        * **Role:** Analyze facial scans provided by the user.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Perform liveness detection to ensure the user is physically present.
            * Detect facial landmarks.
            * Potentially generate facial embeddings for comparison against ID photos or registered images (requires secure image handling and comparison logic in Cloud Functions).

### 3.4. User Support (Optional)

* **Platform:** Google AI
* **Component:** **Gemini API**
    * **Role:** Power an in-app conversational AI assistant.
    * **Responsibilities:** Receive user queries (via App/Cloud Functions) related to the verification process and provide helpful responses based on trained data or FAQs.

## 4. Data Flow & Verification Process

1.  **Initiation:** User opens the Flutter app, potentially logs in (Firebase Auth).
2.  **Document Verification:**
    * User selects ID type and captures an image using the app's camera.
    * App securely uploads the image to a Cloud Function endpoint.
    * Cloud Function triggers Vertex AI Vision OCR.
    * Vertex AI returns extracted text.
    * Cloud Function processes text, potentially performs validation, updates status in Firestore, and returns success/failure to the app.
3.  **Face Verification:**
    * App captures facial scan (ensuring liveness detection requirements are met).
    * App securely uploads data to a Cloud Function endpoint.
    * Cloud Function triggers Vertex AI Vision Face/Liveness detection.
    * Vertex AI returns liveness confirmation and facial data.
    * Cloud Function performs comparison logic (*based on defined rules/data*), updates final verification status in Firestore, and returns success/failure to the app.
4.  **Status Update:** App reflects the final verification status received from the backend or read from Firestore.

## 5. Security Considerations

* **Transport Security:** All communication between the app and backend (Cloud Functions) must use HTTPS.
* **Data Handling:** Sensitive data (ID images, face scans) should be handled securely in Cloud Functions, processed, and ideally discarded promptly unless secure storage is explicitly required and compliant with regulations (e.g., GDPR, local data privacy laws). Avoid storing raw PII images long-term if possible.
* **Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization are critical.
* **Database Security:** Firestore access must be restricted using Firestore Security Rules.
* **API Key Security:** API keys for Google Cloud services must be stored securely (e.g., using Cloud Functions environment variables or Secret Manager) and not embedded in the client app.
* **Compliance:** Adherence to relevant data privacy laws (like India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act, if applicable) regarding the collection and processing of sensitive personal information is paramount.

## 6. Scalability

The use of serverless components like Cloud Functions and scalable cloud services like Firestore and Vertex AI allows the backend infrastructure to automatically scale based on demand, particularly important during the peak pre-verification period.
